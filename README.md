## What is Mapfolio? 
Mapfolio is our team name for our UCSB 2015 Senior Capstone Project. 
Our team consists of Computer Science and Computer Engineering students: Crystal Cheung, Kazbec Seilkhanov, Michael Qiu, Sidney Rhoads, and Tom Craig. 
We are partnering with some awesome mentors from software company, Appfolio, to develop a software as a service, web application to solve floorplan creation for the modern rental company.     

#### Tell Me More
Landlords and tenants expect rental process to be a convenient online experience. While much of rental process has been moved online, the process of efficiently creating and effectively presenting a visual of a rental unit has not yet been perfected.  Tenants do not want to waste their time trying to figure out a complex floor plan with no indication of what the property actually looks like.  Landlords want a more modern way to present their property information to potential tenants.  
Using the gyroscope and accelerometer in a mobile device, this mobile application will allow landlords to generate a floor plan that can be stored in the cloud.


## System Architecture Overview 
+ Javascript to access, process, and interpret a mobile phone’s camera and sensors data. 
+ Ruby on Rails as a web application development framework.
+  [Full-Tilt](https://github.com/richtr/Full-Tilt) to utilize the phone’s gyroscope and accelerometer sensors. 
+  [Fabric.js](http://fabricjs.com/) to show, edit, and render the completed floor plans on HTML canvas.
+  Microsoft Azure to serve up our master branch on GitHub. The link is [mapfolio.cloudapp.net].
